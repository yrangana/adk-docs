The framework provides different types of callbacks that trigger at various stages of an agent's execution. Understanding when each callback fires and what context it receives is key to using them effectively.

## Agent Lifecycle Callbacks

These callbacks are available on *any* agent that inherits from `BaseAgent` (including `LlmAgent`, `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`, etc).

!!! Note
    The specific method names or return types may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., return `None` in Python, return `Optional.empty()` or `Maybe.empty()` in Java). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.

### Before Agent Callback

**When:** Called *immediately before* the agent's `_run_async_impl` (or `_run_live_impl`) method is executed. It runs after the agent's `InvocationContext` is created but *before* its core logic begins.

**Purpose:** Ideal for setting up resources or state needed only for this specific agent's run, performing validation checks on the session state (callback\_context.state) before execution starts, logging the entry point of the agent's activity, or potentially modifying the invocation context before the core logic uses it.

        ```


**Note on the `before_agent_callback` Example:**

* **What it Shows:** This example demonstrates the `before_agent_callback`. This callback runs *right before* the agent's main processing logic starts for a given request.
* **How it Works:** The callback function (`check_if_agent_should_run`) looks at a flag (`skip_llm_agent`) in the session's state.
    * If the flag is `True`, the callback returns a `types.Content` object. This tells the ADK framework to **skip** the agent's main execution entirely and use the callback's returned content as the final response.
    * If the flag is `False` (or not set), the callback returns `None` or an empty object. This tells the ADK framework to **proceed** with the agent's normal execution (calling the LLM in this case).
* **Expected Outcome:** You'll see two scenarios:
    1. In the session *with* the `skip_llm_agent: True` state, the agent's LLM call is bypassed, and the output comes directly from the callback ("Agent... skipped...").
    2. In the session *without* that state flag, the callback allows the agent to run, and you see the actual response from the LLM (e.g., "Hello!").
* **Understanding Callbacks:** This highlights how `before_` callbacks act as **gatekeepers**, allowing you to intercept execution *before* a major step and potentially prevent it based on checks (like state, input validation, permissions).


### After Agent Callback

**When:** Called *immediately after* the agent's `_run_async_impl` (or `_run_live_impl`) method successfully completes. It does *not* run if the agent was skipped due to `before_agent_callback` returning content or if `end_invocation` was set during the agent's run.

**Purpose:** Useful for cleanup tasks, post-execution validation, logging the completion of an agent's activity, modifying final state, or augmenting/replacing the agent's final output.

        ```java
        --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/callbacks/AfterAgentCallbackExample.java:init"
        ```


**Note on the `after_agent_callback` Example:**

* **What it Shows:** This example demonstrates the `after_agent_callback`. This callback runs *right after* the agent's main processing logic has finished and produced its result, but *before* that result is finalized and returned.
* **How it Works:** The callback function (`modify_output_after_agent`) checks a flag (`add_concluding_note`) in the session's state.
    * If the flag is `True`, the callback returns a *new* `types.Content` object. This tells the ADK framework to **replace** the agent's original output with the content returned by the callback.
    * If the flag is `False` (or not set), the callback returns `None` or an empty object. This tells the ADK framework to **use** the original output generated by the agent.
*   **Expected Outcome:** You'll see two scenarios:
    1. In the session *without* the `add_concluding_note: True` state, the callback allows the agent's original output ("Processing complete!") to be used.
    2. In the session *with* that state flag, the callback intercepts the agent's original output and replaces it with its own message ("Concluding note added...").
* **Understanding Callbacks:** This highlights how `after_` callbacks allow **post-processing** or **modification**. You can inspect the result of a step (the agent's run) and decide whether to let it pass through, change it, or completely replace it based on your logic.

## LLM Interaction Callbacks

These callbacks are specific to `LlmAgent` and provide hooks around the interaction with the Large Language Model.

### Before Model Callback

**When:** Called just before the `generate_content_async` (or equivalent) request is sent to the LLM within an `LlmAgent`'s flow.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection and modification of the request going to the LLM. Use cases include adding dynamic instructions, injecting few-shot examples based on state, modifying model config, implementing guardrails (like profanity filters), or implementing request-level caching.

**Return Value Effect:**  
If the callback returns `None` (or a `Maybe.empty()` object in Java), the LLM continues its normal workflow. If the callback returns an `LlmResponse` object, then the call to the LLM is **skipped**. The returned `LlmResponse` is used directly as if it came from the model. This is powerful for implementing guardrails or caching.

        ```

### After Model Callback

**When:** Called just after a response (`LlmResponse`) is received from the LLM, before it's processed further by the invoking agent.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection or modification of the raw LLM response. Use cases include

* logging model outputs,
* reformatting responses,
* censoring sensitive information generated by the model,
* parsing structured data from the LLM response and storing it in `callback_context.state`
* or handling specific error codes.

## Tool Execution Callbacks

These callbacks are also specific to `LlmAgent` and trigger around the execution of tools (including `FunctionTool`, `AgentTool`, etc.) that the LLM might request.

### Before Tool Callback

**When:** Called just before a specific tool's `run_async` method is invoked, after the LLM has generated a function call for it.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection and modification of tool arguments, performing authorization checks before execution, logging tool usage attempts, or implementing tool-level caching.

**Return Value Effect:**

1. If the callback returns `None` (or a `Maybe.empty()` object in Java), the tool's `run_async` method is executed with the (potentially modified) `args`.  
2. If a dictionary (or `Map` in Java) is returned, the tool's `run_async` method is **skipped**. The returned dictionary is used directly as the result of the tool call. This is useful for caching or overriding tool behavior.

        ```java
        --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/callbacks/BeforeToolCallbackExample.java:init"
        ```


### After Tool Callback

**When:** Called just after the tool's `run_async` method completes successfully.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection and modification of the tool's result before it's sent back to the LLM (potentially after summarization). Useful for logging tool results, post-processing or formatting results, or saving specific parts of the result to the session state.

**Return Value Effect:**

1. If the callback returns `None` (or a `Maybe.empty()` object in Java), the original `tool_response` is used.  
2. If a new dictionary is returned, it **replaces** the original `tool_response`. This allows modifying or filtering the result seen by the LLM.
