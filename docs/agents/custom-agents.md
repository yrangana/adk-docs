!!! warning "Advanced Concept"

    Building custom agents by directly implementing `_run_async_impl` provides powerful control but is more complex than using the predefined `LlmAgent` or standard `WorkflowAgent` types. We recommend understanding those foundational agent types first before tackling custom orchestration logic.

# Custom agents

Custom agents provide the ultimate flexibility in ADK, allowing you to define **arbitrary orchestration logic** by inheriting directly from `BaseAgent` and implementing your own control flow. This goes beyond the predefined patterns of `SequentialAgent`, `LoopAgent`, and `ParallelAgent`, enabling you to build highly specific and complex agentic workflows.

## Introduction: Beyond Predefined Workflows

### What is a Custom Agent?

A Custom Agent is essentially any class you create that inherits from `google.adk.agents.BaseAgent` and implements its core execution logic within the `_run_async_impl` asynchronous method. You have complete control over how this method calls other agents (sub-agents), manages state, and handles events.

### Why Use Them?

While the standard [Workflow Agents](workflow-agents/index.md) (`SequentialAgent`, `LoopAgent`, `ParallelAgent`) cover common orchestration patterns, you'll need a Custom agent when your requirements include:

* **Conditional Logic:** Executing different sub-agents or taking different paths based on runtime conditions or the results of previous steps.
* **Complex State Management:** Implementing intricate logic for maintaining and updating state throughout the workflow beyond simple sequential passing.
* **External Integrations:** Incorporating calls to external APIs, databases, or custom Python libraries directly within the orchestration flow control.
* **Dynamic Agent Selection:** Choosing which sub-agent(s) to run next based on dynamic evaluation of the situation or input.
* **Unique Workflow Patterns:** Implementing orchestration logic that doesn't fit the standard sequential, parallel, or loop structures.

## Implementing Custom Logic:

The heart of any custom agent is the `_run_async_impl` method. This is where you define its unique behavior.

* **Signature:** `async def _run_async_impl(self, ctx: InvocationContext) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:`
* **Asynchronous Generator:** It must be an `async def` function and return an `AsyncGenerator`. This allows it to `yield` events produced by sub-agents or its own logic back to the runner.
* **`ctx` (InvocationContext):** Provides access to crucial runtime information, most importantly `ctx.session.state`, which is the primary way to share data between steps orchestrated by your custom agent.

**Key Capabilities within `_run_async_impl`:**

1. **Calling Sub-Agents:** You invoke sub-agents (which are typically stored as instance attributes like `self.my_llm_agent`) using their `run_async` method and yield their events:

    ```python
    async for event in self.some_sub_agent.run_async(ctx):
        # Optionally inspect or log the event
        yield event # Pass the event up
    ```

2. **Managing State:** Read from and write to the session state dictionary (`ctx.session.state`) to pass data between sub-agent calls or make decisions:
    ```python
    # Read data set by a previous agent
    previous_result = ctx.session.state.get("some_key")

    # Make a decision based on state
    if previous_result == "some_value":
        # ... call a specific sub-agent ...
    else:
        # ... call another sub-agent ...

    # Store a result for a later step (often done via a sub-agent's output_key)
    # ctx.session.state["my_custom_result"] = "calculated_value"
    ```

3. **Implementing Control Flow:** Use standard Python constructs (`if`/`elif`/`else`, `for`/`while` loops, `try`/`except`) to create sophisticated, conditional, or iterative workflows involving your sub-agents.

## Managing Sub-Agents and State

Typically, a custom agent orchestrates other agents (like `LlmAgent`, `LoopAgent`, etc.).

* **Initialization:** You usually pass instances of these sub-agents into your custom agent's `__init__` method and store them as instance attributes (e.g., `self.story_generator = story_generator_instance`). This makes them accessible within `_run_async_impl`.
* **`sub_agents` List:** When initializing the `BaseAgent` using `super().__init__(...)`, you should pass a `sub_agents` list. This list tells the ADK framework about the agents that are part of this custom agent's immediate hierarchy. It's important for framework features like lifecycle management, introspection, and potentially future routing capabilities, even if your `_run_async_impl` calls the agents directly via `self.xxx_agent`. Include the agents that your custom logic directly invokes at the top level.
* **State:** As mentioned, `ctx.session.state` is the standard way sub-agents (especially `LlmAgent`s using `output_key`) communicate results back to the orchestrator and how the orchestrator passes necessary inputs down.

## Design Pattern Example: `StoryFlowAgent`

Let's illustrate the power of custom agents with an example pattern: a multi-stage content generation workflow with conditional logic.

**Goal:** Create a system that generates a story, iteratively refines it through critique and revision, performs final checks, and crucially, *regenerates the story if the final tone check fails*.

**Why Custom?** The core requirement driving the need for a custom agent here is the **conditional regeneration based on the tone check**. Standard workflow agents don't have built-in conditional branching based on the outcome of a sub-agent's task. We need custom Python logic (`if tone == "negative": ...`) within the orchestrator.

### Part 1: Simplified custom agent Initialization

We define the `StoryFlowAgent` inheriting from `BaseAgent`. In `__init__`, we store the necessary sub-agents (passed in) as instance attributes and tell the `BaseAgent` framework about the top-level agents this custom agent will directly orchestrate.

```python
--8<-- "examples/python/snippets/agents/custom-agent/storyflow_agent.py:init"
```

---

### Part 2: Defining the Custom Execution Logic

This method orchestrates the sub-agents using standard Python async/await and control flow.

```python
--8<-- "examples/python/snippets/agents/custom-agent/storyflow_agent.py:executionlogic"
```

**Explanation of Logic:**

1. The initial `story_generator` runs. Its output is expected to be in `ctx.session.state["current_story"]`.
2. The `loop_agent` runs, which internally calls the `critic` and `reviser` sequentially for `max_iterations` times. They read/write `current_story` and `criticism` from/to the state.
3. The `sequential_agent` runs, calling `grammar_check` then `tone_check`, reading `current_story` and writing `grammar_suggestions` and `tone_check_result` to the state.
4. **Custom Part:** The `if` statement checks the `tone_check_result` from the state. If it's "negative", the `story_generator` is called *again*, overwriting the `current_story` in the state. Otherwise, the flow ends.

---

### Part 3: Defining the LLM Sub-Agents

These are standard `LlmAgent` definitions, responsible for specific tasks. Their `output_key` parameter is crucial for placing results into the `session.state` where other agents or the custom orchestrator can access them.

```python
GEMINI_FLASH = "gemini-2.0-flash-exp" # Define model constant
--8<-- "examples/python/snippets/agents/custom-agent/storyflow_agent.py:llmagents"
```

---

### Part 4: Instantiating and Running the custom agent

Finally, you instantiate your `StoryFlowAgent` and use the `Runner` as usual.

```python
--8<-- "examples/python/snippets/agents/custom-agent/storyflow_agent.py:story_flow_agent"
```
