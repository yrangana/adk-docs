This section introduces "*workflow agents*" - **specialized agents that control the execution flow of its sub-agents**.  

Workflow agents are specialized components in ADK designed purely for **orchestrating the execution flow of sub-agents**. Their primary role is to manage *how* and *when* other agents run, defining the control flow of a process.

Unlike [LLM Agents](../llm-agents.md), which use Large Language Models for dynamic reasoning and decision-making, Workflow Agents operate based on **predefined logic**. They determine the execution sequence according to their type (e.g., sequential, parallel, loop) without consulting an LLM for the orchestration itself. This results in **deterministic and predictable execution patterns**.

ADK provides three core workflow agent types, each implementing a distinct execution pattern:

- :material-console-line: **Sequential Agents**

    ---

    Executes sub-agents one after another, in **sequence**.

- :material-console-line: **Loop Agents**

    ---

    **Repeatedly** executes its sub-agents until a specific termination condition is met.

- :material-console-line: **Parallel Agents**

    ---

    Executes multiple sub-agents in **parallel**.

## Why Use Workflow Agents?

Workflow agents are essential when you need explicit control over how a series of tasks or agents are executed. They provide:

* **Predictability:** The flow of execution is guaranteed based on the agent type and configuration.
* **Reliability:** Ensures tasks run in the required order or pattern consistently.
* **Structure:** Allows you to build complex processes by composing agents within clear control structures.

While the workflow agent manages the control flow deterministically, the sub-agents it orchestrates can themselves be any type of agent, including intelligent LLM Agent instances. This allows you to combine structured process control with flexible, LLM-powered task execution.
