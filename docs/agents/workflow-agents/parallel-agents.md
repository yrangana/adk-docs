# Parallel agents

## The `ParallelAgent`

The `ParallelAgent` is a [workflow agent](index.md) that executes its sub-agents *concurrently*. This dramatically speeds up workflows where tasks can be performed independently.

Use `ParallelAgent` when: For scenarios prioritizing speed and involving independent, resource-intensive tasks, a `ParallelAgent` facilitates efficient parallel execution. **When sub-agents operate without dependencies, their tasks can be performed concurrently**, significantly reducing overall processing time.

As with other [workflow agents](index.md), the `ParallelAgent` is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are only concerned with their execution (i.e. executing sub-agents in parallel), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs.

### Example

This approach is particularly beneficial for operations like multi-source data retrieval or heavy computations, where parallelization yields substantial performance gains. Importantly, this strategy assumes no inherent need for shared state or direct information exchange between the concurrently executing agents.

### How it works

When the `ParallelAgent`'s `run_async()` method is called:

1. **Concurrent Execution:** It initiates the `run_async()` method of *each* sub-agent present in the `sub_agents` list *concurrently*.  This means all the agents start running at (approximately) the same time.
2. **Independent Branches:**  Each sub-agent operates in its own execution branch.  There is ***no* automatic sharing of conversation history or state between these branches** during execution.
3. **Result Collection:** The `ParallelAgent` manages the parallel execution and, typically, provides a way to access the results from each sub-agent after they have completed (e.g., through a list of results or events). The order of results may not be deterministic.

### Independent Execution and State Management

It's *crucial* to understand that sub-agents within a `ParallelAgent` run independently.  If you *need* communication or data sharing between these agents, you must implement it explicitly.  Possible approaches include:

* **Shared `InvocationContext`:** You could pass a shared `InvocationContext` object to each sub-agent.  This object could act as a shared data store.  However, you'd need to manage concurrent access to this shared context carefully (e.g., using locks) to avoid race conditions.
* **External State Management:**  Use an external database, message queue, or other mechanism to manage shared state and facilitate communication between agents.
* **Post-Processing:** Collect results from each branch, and then implement logic to coordinate data afterwards.

### Full Example: Parallel Web Research

Imagine researching multiple topics simultaneously:

1. **Researcher Agent 1:**  An `LlmAgent` that researches "renewable energy sources."
2. **Researcher Agent 2:**  An `LlmAgent` that researches "electric vehicle technology."
3. **Researcher Agent 3:**  An `LlmAgent` that researches "carbon capture methods."

    ```py
    ParallelAgent(sub_agents=[ResearcherAgent1, ResearcherAgent2, ResearcherAgent3])
    ```

These research tasks are independent.  Using a `ParallelAgent` allows them to run concurrently, potentially reducing the total research time significantly compared to running them sequentially. The results from each agent would be collected separately after they finish.
