# Memory: Long-Term Knowledge with `MemoryService`

We've seen how `Session` tracks the history (`events`) and temporary data (`state`) for a *single, ongoing conversation*. But what if an agent needs to recall information from *past* conversations or access external knowledge bases? This is where the concept of **Long-Term Knowledge** and the **`MemoryService`** come into play.

Think of it this way:

* **`Session` / `State`:** Like your short-term memory during one specific chat.  
* **Long-Term Knowledge (`MemoryService`)**: Like a searchable archive or knowledge library the agent can consult, potentially containing information from many past chats or other sources.

## The `MemoryService` Role

The `BaseMemoryService` defines the interface for managing this searchable, long-term knowledge store. Its primary responsibilities are:

1. **Ingesting Information (`add_session_to_memory`):** Taking the contents of a (usually completed) `Session` and adding relevant information to the long-term knowledge store.  
2. **Searching Information (`search_memory`):** Allowing an agent (typically via a `Tool`) to query the knowledge store and retrieve relevant snippets or context based on a search query.

## `MemoryService` Implementations

ADK provides different ways to implement this long-term knowledge store:

1. **`InMemoryMemoryService`**  

    * **How it works:** Stores session information in the application's memory and performs basic keyword matching for searches.  
    * **Persistence:** None. **All stored knowledge is lost if the application restarts.**  
    * **Requires:** Nothing extra.  
    * **Best for:** Prototyping, simple testing, scenarios where only basic keyword recall is needed and persistence isn't required.

    ```py
    from google.adk.memory import InMemoryMemoryService
    memory_service = InMemoryMemoryService()
    ```

2. **`VertexAiRagMemoryService`**  

    * **How it works:** Leverages Google Cloud's Vertex AI RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) service. It ingests session data into a specified RAG Corpus and uses powerful semantic search capabilities for retrieval.  
    * **Persistence:** Yes. The knowledge is stored persistently within the configured Vertex AI RAG Corpus.  
    * **Requires:** A Google Cloud project, appropriate permissions, necessary SDKs (`pip install google-adk[vertexai]`), and a pre-configured Vertex AI RAG Corpus resource name/ID.  
    * **Best for:** Production applications needing scalable, persistent, and semantically relevant knowledge retrieval, especially when deployed on Google Cloud.

    ```py
    # Requires: pip install google-adk[vertexai]
    # Plus GCP setup, RAG Corpus, and authentication
    from google.adk.memory import VertexAiRagMemoryService

    # The RAG Corpus name or ID
    RAG_CORPUS_RESOURCE_NAME = "projects/your-gcp-project-id/locations/us-central1/ragCorpora/your-corpus-id"
    # Optional configuration for retrieval
    SIMILARITY_TOP_K = 5
    VECTOR_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7

    memory_service = VertexAiRagMemoryService(
        rag_corpus=RAG_CORPUS_RESOURCE_NAME,
        similarity_top_k=SIMILARITY_TOP_K,
        vector_distance_threshold=VECTOR_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD
    )
    ```

## How Memory Works in Practice

The typical workflow involves these steps:

1. **Session Interaction:** A user interacts with an agent via a `Session`, managed by a `SessionService`. Events are added, and state might be updated.  
2. **Ingestion into Memory:** At some point (often when a session is considered complete or has yielded significant information), your application calls `memory_service.add_session_to_memory(session)`. This extracts relevant information from the session's events and adds it to the long-term knowledge store (in-memory dictionary or RAG Corpus).  
3. **Later Query:** In a *different* (or the same) session, the user might ask a question requiring past context (e.g., "What did we discuss about project X last week?").  
4. **Agent Uses Memory Tool:** An agent equipped with a memory-retrieval tool (like the built-in `load_memory` tool) recognizes the need for past context. It calls the tool, providing a search query (e.g., "discussion project X last week").  
5. **Search Execution:** The tool internally calls `memory_service.search_memory(app_name, user_id, query)`.  
6. **Results Returned:** The `MemoryService` searches its store (using keyword matching or semantic search) and returns relevant snippets as a `SearchMemoryResponse` containing a list of `MemoryResult` objects (each potentially holding events from a relevant past session).  
7. **Agent Uses Results:** The tool returns these results to the agent, usually as part of the context or function response. The agent can then use this retrieved information to formulate its final answer to the user.

## Example: Adding and Searching Memory

This example demonstrates the basic flow using the `InMemory` services for simplicity.

    # 3. Runner executes the `load_memory` tool, which calls `memory_service.search_memory`.
    # 4. `InMemoryMemoryService` finds the relevant text ("My favorite project is Project Alpha.") from session1.
    # 5. Tool returns this text in a FunctionResponse event.
    # 6. Agent (LLM) receives the function response, processes the retrieved text.
    # 7. Agent generates the final answer (e.g., "Your favorite project is Project Alpha.").
