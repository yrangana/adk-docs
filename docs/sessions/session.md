# Session: Tracking Individual Conversations

Following our Introduction, let's dive into the `Session`. Think back to the idea of a "conversation thread." Just like you wouldn't start every text message from scratch, agents need context from the ongoing interaction. **`Session`** is the ADK object designed specifically to track and manage these individual conversation threads.

## The `Session` Object

When a user starts interacting with your agent, the `SessionService` creates a `Session` object (`google.adk.sessions.Session`). This object acts as the container holding everything related to that *one specific chat thread*. Here are its key properties:

* **Identification (`id`, `app_name`, `user_id`):** Unique labels for the conversation.  
    * `id`: A unique identifier for *this specific* conversation thread, essential for retrieving it later.  
    * `app_name`: Identifies which agent application this conversation belongs to.  
    * `user_id`: Links the conversation to a particular user.  
* **History (`events`):** A chronological sequence of all interactions (`Event` objects – user messages, agent responses, tool actions) that have occurred within this specific thread.  
* **Session Data (`state`):** A place to store temporary data relevant *only* to this specific, ongoing conversation. This acts as a scratchpad for the agent during the interaction. We will cover how to use and manage `state` in detail in the next section.  
* **Activity Tracking (`last_update_time`):** A timestamp indicating the last time an event was added to this conversation thread.

### Example: Examining Session Properties

```py
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService, Session

# Create a simple session to examine its properties
temp_service = InMemorySessionService()
example_session: Session = temp_service.create_session(
    app_name="my_app",
    user_id="example_user",
    state={"initial_key": "initial_value"} # State can be initialized
)

print(f"--- Examining Session Properties ---")
print(f"ID (`id`):                {example_session.id}")
print(f"Application Name (`app_name`): {example_session.app_name}")
print(f"User ID (`user_id`):         {example_session.user_id}")
print(f"State (`state`):           {example_session.state}") # Note: Only shows initial state here
print(f"Events (`events`):         {example_session.events}") # Initially empty
print(f"Last Update (`last_update_time`): {example_session.last_update_time:.2f}")
print(f"---------------------------------")

# Clean up (optional for this example)
temp_service.delete_session(app_name=example_session.app_name,
                            user_id=example_session.user_id, session_id=example_session.id)
```

*(**Note:** The state shown above is only the initial state. State updates happen via events, as discussed in the State section.)*

## Managing Sessions with a `SessionService`

You don't typically create or manage `Session` objects directly. Instead, you use a **`SessionService`**. This service acts as the central manager responsible for the entire lifecycle of your conversation sessions.

Its core responsibilities include:

* **Starting New Conversations:** Creating fresh `Session` objects when a user begins an interaction.  
* **Resuming Existing Conversations:** Retrieving a specific `Session` (using its ID) so the agent can continue where it left off.  
* **Saving Progress:** Appending new interactions (`Event` objects) to a session's history. This is also the mechanism through which session `state` gets updated (more in the State section).  
* **Listing Conversations:** Finding the active session threads for a particular user and application.  
* **Cleaning Up:** Deleting `Session` objects and their associated data when conversations are finished or no longer needed.

## `SessionService` Implementations

ADK provides different `SessionService` implementations, allowing you to choose the storage backend that best suits your needs:

1. **`InMemorySessionService`**  

    * **How it works:** Stores all session data directly in the application's memory.  
    * **Persistence:** None. **All conversation data is lost if the application restarts.**  
    * **Requires:** Nothing extra.  
    * **Best for:** Quick tests, local development, examples, and scenarios where long-term persistence isn't required.

    ```py
    from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
    session_service = InMemorySessionService()
    ```

2. **`DatabaseSessionService`**  

    * **How it works:** Connects to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) to store session data persistently in tables.  
    * **Persistence:** Yes. Data survives application restarts.  
    * **Requires:** A configured database and the `sqlalchemy` library (`pip install google-adk[database]`).  
    * **Best for:** Applications needing reliable, persistent storage that you manage yourself.

    ```py
    # Requires: pip install google-adk[database]
    from google.adk.sessions import DatabaseSessionService
    # Example using a local SQLite file:
    db_url = "sqlite:///./my_agent_data.db"
    session_service = DatabaseSessionService(db_url=db_url)
    ```

3. **`VertexAiSessionService`**  

    * **How it works:** Uses Google Cloud's Vertex AI infrastructure via API calls for session management.  
    * **Persistence:** Yes. Data is managed reliably and scalably by Google Cloud.  
    * **Requires:** A Google Cloud project, appropriate permissions, necessary SDKs (`pip install google-adk[vertexai]`), and the Reasoning Engine resource name/ID.  
    * **Best for:** Scalable production applications deployed on Google Cloud, especially when integrating with other Vertex AI features.

    ```py
    # Requires: pip install google-adk[vertexai]
    # Plus GCP setup and authentication
    from google.adk.sessions import VertexAiSessionService

    PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
    LOCATION = "us-central1"
    # The app_name used with this service should be the Reasoning Engine ID or name
    REASONING_ENGINE_APP_NAME = "projects/your-gcp-project-id/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/your-engine-id"

    session_service = VertexAiSessionService(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
    # Use REASONING_ENGINE_APP_NAME when calling service methods, e.g.:
    # session_service.create_session(app_name=REASONING_ENGINE_APP_NAME, ...)
    ```

Choosing the right `SessionService` is key to defining how your agent's conversation history and temporary data are stored and persist.

## The Session Lifecycle

<img src="../../assets/session_lifecycle.png" alt="Session lifecycle">

Here’s a simplified flow of how `Session` and `SessionService` work together during a conversation turn:

1. **Start or Resume:** A user sends a message. Your application's `Runner` uses the `SessionService` to either `create_session` (for a new chat) or `get_session` (to retrieve an existing one).  
2. **Context Provided:** The `Runner` gets the appropriate `Session` object from the service, providing the agent with access to its `state` and `events`.  
3. **Agent Processing:** The agent uses the current user message, its instructions, and potentially the session `state` and `events` history to decide on a response.  
4. **Response & State Update:** The agent generates a response (and potentially flags data to be updated in the `state`). The `Runner` packages this as an `Event`.  
5. **Save Interaction:** The `Runner` calls `session_service.append_event(...)` with the `Session` and the new `Event`. The service adds the `Event` to the history and updates the session's `state` in storage based on information within the event. The session's `last_update_time` is also updated.  
6. **Ready for Next:** The agent's response goes to the user. The updated `Session` is now stored by the `SessionService`, ready for the next turn (which restarts the cycle at step 1, usually with `get_session`).  
7. **End Conversation:** When the conversation is over, ideally your application calls `session_service.delete_session(...)` to clean up the stored session data.

This cycle highlights how the `SessionService` ensures conversational continuity by managing the history and state associated with each `Session` object.
